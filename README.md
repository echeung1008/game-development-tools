# Blue Muffin Games Tools

Reusable Unity tools and scripts developed by [Edmund Cheung (Blue Muffin)](https://bluemuffindev.wixsite.com/home).  
These utilities were originally created for my games **Compactory** and **Arctic Slopes**, and will continue to evolve as I build future projects. They are designed to make gameplay systems, editor workflows, and general development faster and easier.
